## Overview

### The challenge

The main challenge for me in this project was making sure the layout looks good on different devices. I had to work on the responsiveness so that the design adjusts properly whether itâ€™s on a phone, tablet, or desktop.

Another part was adding hover and focus states to the button. This was important because it makes the page feel more interactive and shows the user when they are about to click something.

## My process

### Built with
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

From this project, I learned how to structure my HTML and style it with CSS to get a neat design. I also practiced creating a button with both text and an icon, which helped me understand better how to align elements inside a button.

I also improved in working with responsiveness. Using media queries, I was able to make the layout change on smaller screens, like stacking items and adjusting the font sizes so it still looks good. This really showed me how important it is to think about different devices when building a webpage.

Below are the code snippets;

```html
      <button>
          <img src="./images/icon-cart.svg" alt="cart" />
          <h4>Add to Cart</h4>
        </button>
```
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        padding: 20px;
    }

    .card {
        flex-direction: column;
        height: auto;
    }

    .image img {
        width: 100%;
        height: 30vh; /* takes 30% of screen height */
        object-fit: cover;
        border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
    }

    .image-text {
        padding: 20px;
    }

    h2 {
        font-size: 28px;
    }

    .amount h4 {
        font-size: 28px;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to keep improving my responsiveness by practicing how layouts adapt smoothly across different screen sizes. I also plan to refine my use of media queries to handle multiple breakpoints more effectively, making sure designs remain consistent on both smaller and larger devices.
